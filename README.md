## üõ†Ô∏è Approach and Design Choices

### Component Design

- **`InputField`**: This component was built from the ground up to be highly flexible. It leverages `cva` (class-variance-authority) to manage its numerous variants and sizes, making it easy to extend. State management (e.g., for the password toggle) is handled internally with `React.useState`.

- **`DataTable`**: This component is designed to be generic and type-safe, using TypeScript generics (`<T>`) to handle any data structure. It includes features like sorting and row selection. It is built upon the ShadCN `Table` component for a solid structural and stylistic foundation.

### Styling

- **TailwindCSS**: Used for all styling to allow for rapid UI development and maintain a consistent design system.
- **ShadCN UI**: Leveraged for its accessible and unstyled component primitives, which serve as a base for the custom components.
- **Dark Mode**: Implemented using `next-themes`, allowing for easy styling with Tailwind's `dark:` variants.

### Accessibility

Basic accessibility has been addressed by:

- Using semantic HTML elements.
- Adding `aria-*` attributes for states like `aria-invalid` and `aria-label` for interactive elements to ensure they are understandable by screen readers.
